#TARPIG.SH

A quick script I built to take a client's drive image after I use ddrescue for recovery/backup, and then compress it for cold storage as per our SLA.

Since I don't do it often I forget the command, but I do it often enough that I need to use it periodically, I put this together to save me the time of having to remember it.
